Word Recognition and Spotting for Indian languages is one of the problems that still remains unsolved and is one of the difficult problems to solve. In this problem, the goal is to be able to identify the words and text of any given document, i.e., it could be historical or an handwritten document or in any other form.

To solve research problems like these, there is need to collect data corresponding to that language. For non-Indian languages, many such public datasets exist, encouraging researchers to work on these problems for those languages. The demo for one such work can be found <a href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/irdemo/hw-demo/">here</a>, this demo applciation allows us to search for words in a dataset that contains the writings of George Washington. Working on this problem for Indian languages will enable us to do automatic digitization of millions of scripts available for Indian languages. Not only can we automate digitization of scripts, but also use this data to build applications that can automate postal processes, matching documents that help in forsenic and crime domain etc.

However for Indian languages, it becomes difficult to work on these problems due to lack of considerable amount of data available publicly. We have taken the initiative to collect Indic handwritten data for various languages so that it can be made available for other researchers to pursue research in this domain.

To add to the above information, this process is a part of <a href="https://imprint-india.org/information-access-from-document-images-of-indian-languages">project</a> that is being funded by a Government initiative IMPRINT.
